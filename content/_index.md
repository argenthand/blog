title: Hi, I'm Bhargav!

I'm a fullstack engineer specializing in JavaScript, .NET Core, Azure and Docker. I'm a Lead Developer 
at Fulfillment IQ, where I build high-performance products in the supply chain space. Currently, I'm involved with 
developing WarehouseAnywhere's flagship inventory and asset management system.

Welcome to my corner on the internet. This blog is where I write about my experiences with interesting programming 
stuff.
